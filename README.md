# Huda_Clinic_WEB

# Project Description

The HUDA web application is a React based website application that assists patients that use the HUDA clinic in a variety of ways that
streamline the many tedious processes patients typically have to go through such as:

- Registering for Athena
- Creating/Requesting appointments from the patient side
- Viewing appointments
- Viewing inbox of messages from the clinic
- Viewing medical history

Some of the technologies that we used in the application are:

- Visual Studio Code
- React framework
- AthenaOne API
- Emailjs API
- NodeJs
- Google maps API

Some of the challenges that we faced during the development process were:

- Incorrect API documentation that was provided to us
- API Services communication delays
- Only 2 total app developers
- Inherited a non-functional web application in which we had to start all over from scratch
